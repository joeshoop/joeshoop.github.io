	<p><em>Booking Suite</em> is a part of Booking.com. They make software for hotels - to help manage bookings and reservations, and for create and managing a website.</p>
	<p>While there, I was involved with two big projects - one was a update to their CMS, called 'Back Office' internally. Lots of front end using scss.</p>
