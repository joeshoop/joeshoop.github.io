			<p class="lead"><em>Blix</em> is an app to keep track of 'local knowledge' type spots. Things you don't necessarily want to share with the world. Things you'd only really want to share with friends and family, or people you trust. Things like dispersed camping spots in national forests, or swimming holes, or good spots to throw anchor on a sail boat, or places to hang a hammock, or places you'd like to visit for international travel.</p>

	<h3>Initial Exploration/Project Goals</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Update the proof of concept app to make more sense</li>
		<li>Establish a visual style and some sort of brand for Blix, on a pretty tight budget and timeline</li>
		<li>Clarify what the app is for, and why it might be useful to potential users</li>
		<li>Screenshots of early design concepts and prototypes</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Further Refinement</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Custom designed icon system</li>
		<li>Category/Tagging system</li>
		<li>Integrating text search with tags</li>
		<li>Separating my pins from friends pins from global pins</li>
		<li>Dealing with a privacy system for pins</li>
		<li>Appeal of the app is to keep track of 'local knowledge' type spots. Things you don't necessarily want to share with the world. Things you'd only really want to share with friends and family, or people you trust. Things like dispersed camping spots in national forests, or swimming holes, or good spots to throw anchor on a sail boat, or places to hang a hammock, or places you'd like to visit for international travel.</li>
		<li>above is in direct conflict with how social apps normally grow themselves</li>
