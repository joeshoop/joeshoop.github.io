	<p><em>Blue Nile</em> is the largest online retailer of diamonds. Their iPhone app hadn't seen a major update in a few years, so it needed an update for the new aesthetic of iOS 7, and for the larger screen on the new iPhone. I worked with Toy Rockets to refresh and redesign their existing app, and to add a new 'Try it On' feature so people could see how a ring might look on their own hand.</p>

	<p>The Ring Builder guides a user through the steps of designing their own custom ring, from choosing a band, then a setting and finally a stone.</p>

<section class="copy">
	<p>After building their ring, the user can take a photo of their hand (or a partner's) and get a to-scale preview of how it will look. </p>
