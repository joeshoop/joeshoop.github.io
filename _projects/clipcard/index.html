	<h3>Initial Explorations/Project Goals</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Existing UX doesn't reflect some more recent updates in the software the team is building.</li>
		<li>Make combined searching feel clearer and appeal simpler than it is</li>
		<li>Hide the complexity of multiple data sources happening behind the scenes.</li>
		<li>Users just want to find the thing they're looking for, and not have to remember which email or cloud storage or git repo something was on.</li>
		<li>Show users just enough info about the source to help them find the thing they want</li>
	</ul>
</section>

	<h3>Further Refinements</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Working within a tight budget to make a big impact, Making smart tweaks while not being able to make sweeping changes.</li>
		<li>Was not around for a lot of the dev implementation phase, but came back for followup feedback meetings, and some followup brainstorm sessions.</li>
	</ul>
