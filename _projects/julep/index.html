	<p><em>Julep Maven</em> is a monthly box full of high quality nail polishes and other beauty products. Julep was expanding their subscription with new tiers, giving subscribers more options to customize the items they would recive in their upcoming monthly box, and they needed a new app.</p>

	<p>I worked with Toy Rockets to design a new app for Julep that included this upgraded flexibility and helped clarify how to take advantage of these new features.</p>

		<h3>Initial Exporation/Project Goals</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Updating the monthly box to allow for more flexibility for customers</li>
			<li>UX for customizing boxes and choosing custom addons</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Further Refinement</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Preserve and Reinforce the existing Julep brand</li>
			<li>Challenge of communicating box content restrictions</li>
			<li>some items are worth more than others. You could choose three polishes, but not three mascaras.</li>
			<li>Design home screen so it can incrementally be updates as new features are added</li>
