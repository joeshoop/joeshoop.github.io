	<p><em>Julep Maven</em> is a monthly box full of high quality nail polishes and other beauty products. Julep was expanding their Maven subscription with new tiers, giving subscribers more options to customize the items they would recive in their upcoming monthly box, and they needed a new iPhone app as part of this update.</p>

	<p>I worked with Toy Rockets to design an app for Julep that included this upgraded flexibility and helped clarify how to take advantage of these new features.</p>
</section>

<section class="copy">
	<p>We needed to design the app in a way that allowed for incremental feature additions as development work was to be completed in stages.</p>
	<p>At first, the app was exclusive to existing Maven subscribers. Users could see what was included in that month's box, go with a different box style if they preferred, and choose from a small list of add-on items to include with their shipment.</p>

	<p>Later, the app would include special sales with a selection of items users could purchase independent of their subscription. This update would also add a cart and payment flow.</p>

	<p>Finally, all products available on the website would become browseable, searchable, and available for purchase in the app.</p>

		<h3>Initial Exporation/Project Goals</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Updating the monthly box to allow for more flexibility for customers</li>
			<li>UX for customizing boxes and choosing custom addons</li>
		</ul>

	<section>
		<h3>Further Refinement</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Preserve and Reinforce the existing Julep brand</li>
			<li>Challenge of communicating box content restrictions</li>
			<li>some items are worth more than others. You could choose three polishes, but not three mascaras.</li>
			<li>Design home screen so it can incrementally be updates as new features are added</li>
