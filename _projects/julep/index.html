	<h3>Beauty in a Box</h3>
	<p><em>Julep Maven</em> is a monthly subscription box full of high quality nail polishes and other beauty products. Julep was expanding their Maven subscription with new tiers, giving subscribers more options to customize the items they would recive in their upcoming monthly box, and they needed a new <span class="highlight">iPhone App</span> as part of this update.</p>

	<p>I worked with Toy Rockets to design an app for Julep that included this upgraded flexibility and helped clarify how to take advantage of these new features.</p>

	<h3>Version One</h3>
	<p>At first, the app was exclusive to existing Maven subscribers. Customers could see what was included in that month's box, pick a different style if they preferred, and sometimes choose a color for an item.</p>

	<h3>Version Two</h3>
	<p>Later, after the changes and upgrades to the Maven subscription were introduced, the app would be updated to include a flow that would allow subscribers to customize their entire box.</p>

	<h5 class="text-small caps">A Complete Shopping Experience</h5>
	<h3>Version Three</h3>
	<p>Finally, all products available on the website would become browseable, searchable, and available for purchase in the app. The app would see another udate to include a cart and a full checkout flow.</p>

		<h3>Initial Exporation/Project Goals</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Updating the monthly box to allow for more flexibility for customers</li>
			<li>UX for customizing boxes and choosing custom addons</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Further Refinement</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Preserve and Reinforce the existing Julep brand</li>
			<li>Challenge of communicating box content restrictions</li>
			<li>some items are worth more than others. You could choose three polishes, but not three mascaras.</li>
			<li>Design home screen so it can incrementally be updates as new features are added</li>
