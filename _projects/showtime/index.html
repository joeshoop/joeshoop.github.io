	<h3>Initial Exploration/project goals</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Show early screenshots and sketches if they exist</li>
		<li>Web app already existed, but it was flash based, and realied heavily on a cursor for hover states.</li>
		<li>Didnt work on phone or ipad because of the flash</li>
		<li>Client education on what best practices are for iOS apps. (No hover, button styles, etc)</li>
		<li>Balance of Showtime brand and UX, and UX expectations for iOS apps.</li>
	</ul>
</section>

	<h3>Further Refinement</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Cleaning up and aliasing logo for display at small sizes.</li>
		<li>Starting to deal with retina assets</li>
		<li>Settling on a stepped gradient for red colors in the app</li>
		<li>show chart/printout I made to use as reference for hex colors</li>
		<li>ogic behind the clor choices (10% darker each step, I think)</li>
		<li>Very dark app, still wanted to create some amount of dimension so app would fit within the iOS ecosystem of the time.</li>
		<li>Starting to step away from the Skeuomorphic style, but still designing within pre-iOS7 style.</li>
	</ul>
</seciton>

	<h3>Finished Product</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Icon grid for exporting assets</li>
		<li>Media Reception/Awards</li>
		<li>Trip to NY for intensive design week</li>
		<li>Early competitor to HBO Go.</li>
