	<h3>Times Square Photo Booth</h3>
	<p><em>Starbucks</em> wanted to update the <span class="highlight">Touch-Screen Photo Booth</span> in their Times Square flagship store with a custom-built solution that made it really quick & easy for visitors to take a souvenir selfie while they were waiting for their coffee.</p>

	<p>I worked directly with Starbucks to design the UX and simple UI for this new photobooth.</p>

	<p>Customer interaction with the updated photobooth has been 400% higher than the previous version.</p>

	<h3>Coffee Passport</h3>
	<p><em>Starbucks</em> was working on a new digital version of their Coffee Passport, which allows partners and customers to keep a journal of tasting notes as they try all of the different available roasts, and unlock stamps as they go.</p>

	<p>I helped with a few of the stamps, as well as few variations of an <span class="highlight">App&nbsp;Icon</span>, seen below.</p>
