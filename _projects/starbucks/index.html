	<h3>Starbucks</h3>
	<p><em>Starbucks</em> wanted to update the <span class="highlight">Touch-Screen Photo Booth</span> in their Times Square flagship store with a custom-built solution that made it really quick & easy for visitors to take a souvenir selfie while they were waiting for their coffee.</p>

	<p>I worked directly with Starbucks to design the UX and simple UI for this new photobooth.</p>

	<!-- <p>Customer interaction with the updated photobooth has been 400% higher than the previous version.</p> -->

				<h5>Say Cheese!</h5>
				<h3>Touchscreen Photobooth</h3>
				<p>The goal of this project was to provide a fun memento of a customer's visit to the Times Square Starbucks Store, and ultimately, to capture an email for the Starbucks newsletter. We aimed to reduce as much friction as possible - a photo can be sent with as few as 4 total taps (not including typing an email address with an on-screen keyboard).</p>

			<h5>Tasting Notes</h5>
			<h3>Coffee Passport</h3>
			<p><em>Starbucks</em> was working on a new digital version of their Coffee Passport, which allows partners and customers to keep a journal of tasting notes as they try all of the different available roasts, and unlock stamps as they go.</p>

			<p>I helped with a few of the stamps, as well as few illustrations for an <span class="highlight">App&nbsp;Icon</span>, seen below.</p>
