	<h3>I am an independent Product Designer in sunny Seattle, WA.</h3>
	<p>I have been designing and building things for screens of all shapes and sizes for the last 15 years, and in that time have designed products for companies like Showtime, Target, Starbucks, Microsoft, Blue Nile, Julep & more.</p>

	<p>I have experience designing UX & UI for iPhone and iPad apps, Responsive Web projects and Front-end web development. I am also pretty good at eating burritos.
